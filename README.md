# C/C++ 3-Screen Window Setup

This project provides a 3-screen window setup for C/C++ programming:

- **User Input:** Use the `input.txt` file to provide input to your program.
- **Program Output:** The output of your program will be written to the `output.txt` file.
- **Source Code:** Write your C or C++ code in the appropriate source file.

## Compilation Instructions

- If your source file is in `C`, use `gcc` to compile.
- If your source file is in `C++`, update the `tasks.json` file under the `.vscode` folder to use `g++` instead of `gcc` for compilation.

## Running the Code

- To build and run your code, press `Ctrl+Shift+B` in Visual Studio Code.

This setup helps you easily manage input and output files while developing
